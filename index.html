      <h1>UBAM</h1>

      <p>is an organizational group of members of the UBports community, aiming to bring the right infrastructure to the community to enable best possible navigation, chit-chat and productivity alike with a quickly growing community.</p>
      <p>At the moment, the community work is mostly focused on the <a href="https://t.me/ubports">Telegram groups</a>, but we are ready to embrace all other media as a significant portion of the community is sighted there.</p>

      <h2>UBFR</h2>

      <p>Also known as the Welcoming Team, the UBports First Responders are the biggest part of UBAM that make sure community newcomers are welcomed, introduced to the community and supplied with quick answers to trivial questions or connected with the right people that know the answers.</p>
